# **PART I: K-MATHEMATICAL OPERATING SYSTEM (K-MOS)**

## **Complete Formal Specification Stack**

### **I. CROWN OMEGA FRAMEWORK (COF): Nuclear-Grade Mathematics**

**Classification:** Formal Verification System
**Failure Probability:** P < 10⁻²⁴

The Crown Omega Framework defines a computational environment where logic-gate failure or arithmetic error probability is bounded below nuclear safety thresholds.

**Formal Definition:**
```
COF = (Ω, 𝕍, ⊢_Ω, P_{fail}, τ_{max}, E_{max})
where:
Ω = {ω₁, ω₂, ..., ω_n} is the set of verified mathematical atoms
𝕍: Ω → {True, False} is the nuclear verification function
⊢_Ω is the Omega-derivation relation
P_{fail} < 10^{-24} (failure probability bound)
τ_{max} ∈ ℕ is maximum computation steps
E_{max} ∈ ℝ⁺ is maximum energy consumption
```

**Implementation:** Dependent Type Theory with hardware-integrated verification

---

### **II. EIDO MATH FORMALISM (EMF): Morphic Symbolic Systems**

**Classification:** Geometric Logic System

Eido Math treats symbols as Topological Manifolds using Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT).

**Formal Definition:**
```
EidosSpace = (M, g, ∇, ℱ, ≅)
where:
M is a smooth manifold (dimension = complexity)
g: TM × TM → ℝ is the meaning metric
∇ is the Levi-Civita connection for logical consistency
ℱ: M → Language is the formalization functor
≅ is homotopy equivalence of proofs
```

**Key Property:** Inconsistencies appear as geometric singularities (R_{μν} → ∞)

---

### **III. Λ_BIOGENESIS: Biological Recursion Mathematics**

**Classification:** Autopoietic Mathematical System

Mathematical functions modeled after self-creating biological systems.

**Formal Definition:**
```
MathOrganism = (G, μ, ρ, σ, H)
where:
G is the mathematical genome (λ-term)
μ: G × ℝ⁺ → G is mutation with metabolic cost
ρ: G → ℝ⁺ is replication rate
σ: G → ℝ is selection fitness
H: G → ℝ⁺ is homeostasis function
```

where:
Obj = {Mathematical Universes}
Hom(U,V) = {Bridges: U → V}
F: C → D, G: D → C are adjoint functors
η, ε: natural isomorphisms
```

**Key Theorem:** GF ≅ 1_C and FG ≅ 1_D (Perfect bidirectional translation)

---

### **V. τ-MATH BRIDGE: Temporal Mathematics**

**The Retrocausal Equation:**
```
Ψ(τ) = ∫ K_{past}(τ,τ')Ψ(τ')dτ' + ∫ K_{future}(τ,τ')Ψ(τ')dτ'
```

**Application:** Time-Symmetric Computing - verify calculations by running logic backward

---

### **VI. K-UNIFIED CORE ARCHITECTURE**
