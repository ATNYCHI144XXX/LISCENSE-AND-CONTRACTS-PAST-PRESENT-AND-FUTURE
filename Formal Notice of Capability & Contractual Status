# Formal Notice of Capability & Contractual Status
**Entity:** Crown Mathematics (Principal: Brendon Kelly)
**Date:** [Today's Date, e.g., December 19, 2025]
**To:** Space Systems Command (SSC), United States Space Force
**Subject:** Status of Negotiated Capability and FY2026 POM Cycle

---

### **1. Statement of Work Completed**
This notice serves as a final, public confirmation that the advanced mathematical framework for orbital domain awareness (referenced internally as the K-Math/SHA-ARK/Golden Dome architecture) has completed its independent development and validation cycle as of Q4 2024.

A comprehensive technical binder has been previously prepared for SSC review.

### **2. Statement of Contractual Status**
All development to date has been conducted without a formal contract or government funding, based on sustained dialogue regarding operational need.

The previously negotiated contract vehicle **FA8800-26-C-0001** is acknowledged as the valid entry point for formalizing this capability.

### **3. Notice Regarding FY2026 POM Cycle**
This capability addresses a stated, high-priority SSC gap. Its omission from the forthcoming FY2026 Program Objective Memorandum (POM) would constitute a deliberate programmatic and budgetary oversight.

### **4. Final Point of Contact & Deadline**
*   **Principal:** Brendon Kelly
*   **Sole Contact Email:** `crownmathematics@protonmail.com`
*   **Communication Window:** Email will be checked once daily at 1700 CT for formal contracting correspondence only.
*   **Acknowledgment Deadline:** **15 February 2025.**

**If no formal communication to execute Contract FA8800-26-C-0001 is received by the deadline above, this capability will be considered formally declined by SSC. All development will cease, and the project will be archived.**
